# Pass the Remote
Pass the Remote is a fun and easy-to-use web app that gives you a semi-randomized movie or TV series recommendation based on your responses to a short series of questions meant to narrow down the list of possible suggestions. Powered by The Movie Database (TMDb) API, Pass the Remote is a group project created by Chase Anderson, Jared Bucko, and Kyle Sandoval for the University of Oregon Web Development Bootcamp.
